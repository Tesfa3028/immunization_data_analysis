### Immunization data analysis

This project is designed to conduct complete data analysis with the goal of developing a model to classify children as under-immunized or non-immunized, and to identify the most influential features associated with immunization status of children. For the analysis, we use a dataset is derived from raw data collected in Ethiopia in 2022 as part of a baseline survey designed to assess childhood immunization coverage and its associated factors among selected host and refugee populations. The dataset includes information on 3,200 children aged 12–23 months and their mothers or caretakers. It contains a total of 107 variables that captured information on demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, health‑care access, and knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) related to immunization, among other relevant factors.

The analysis will be presented in two parts: 
- Part 1 will involve data cleaning and exploration to understand the nature of the data where descriptive statistics are used to summarize and present the data.
- Part 2 will present the application of appropriate machine learning concepts that will be used to answer the research questions.
